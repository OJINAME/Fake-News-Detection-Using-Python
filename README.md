# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Python
Fake news do not require any introduction. It is very much easy to spread all the fake information in today’s all-connected world across the internet.
To combat the spread of fake news, it’s critical to determine the information’s legitimacy, which this Data Science project can help with. To do so, Python can be used, and a model is created using TfidfVectorizer.

The dataset used for this project was gotten from kaggle:
